## About Me
Hello! My name is Carlos Valdez and this is a GitHub about myself! I am currently in school at Mizzou persuing a degree in general studies! I love to stay active by playing football or basketball in my free time as well as working out. My favorite football team would have to be the Chiefs and my favorite basketball team would have to be the Grizzlies. I have lived in Columbia for around 3 years now and enjoy the mizzou culture!
