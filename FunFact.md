## Coke and Mentos

[Back To Home]()

Did you know that the science behind the coke and mentos experiment is because of something called *nucleation sites* that are on the surface of the mentos? Nucleation sites is very comparable to craters that are on the moon but a lot smaller. What happens is the carbon dioxide in the soda interacts with the nucleation sites causing it to foam up and spurt out of the bottle. The reason we use diet coke rather than regualr coke is because diet coke has way less sugar. The sugar molecules are thick and when the mentos are dropped into the regualr coke, they prevent the carbon dioxide from escaping.
